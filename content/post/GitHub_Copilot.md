##### GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence (AI) powered code assistant that is built on OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. It is designed to help developers write code more efficiently by generating code suggestions based on the context of what the developer is working on.

##### GitHub Copilot is currently available as a preview for Visual Studio Code, and it is free to use.


GitHub Copilot can be used as a plugin for Visual Studio Code, and it works by analyzing the code in real-time, along with the comments and the context of the code, and suggests code snippets and functions that are relevant to the developer's task. It can also complete code fragments based on the context of what is being written.

However, it is important to note that GitHub Copilot is still in the early stages of development and may not always produce optimal code suggestions. Developers are advised to review the suggestions made by the tool and ensure that they align with the project's requirements and best practices.
