## Install Visual Studio

Go to the Visual Studio download page on the Microsoft website. The link is https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.

The choice of which edition to use depends on your needs and budget. If you're an individual developer or a student, the Community edition is likely sufficient. If you're working on a small team and need more advanced features, the Professional edition may be a better fit. And if you're part of a large organization that needs the most advanced tools and features, the Enterprise edition is the way to go.

Click Free Download to download the installer. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions to install Visual Studio.
