## Install Visual Studio:

Go to the Visual Studio download page on the Microsoft website. The link is https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.

**1. The choice of which edition to use depends on your needs and budget.**

- If you're an individual developer or a student, the Community edition is likely sufficient. 

- If you're working on a small team and need more advanced features, the Professional edition may be a better fit. 

- And if you're part of a large organization that needs the most advanced tools and features, the Enterprise edition is the way to go.

Click **"Free download"** or **"Free trial"** to download the installer. 


Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions to install Visual Studio.

**2. Modify Visual Studio workloads:**
