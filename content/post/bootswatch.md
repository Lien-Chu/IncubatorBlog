Now that we have our application up and running, let's style it up with Bootswatch!

##### Here are the steps you can follow to add Bootswatch to your application:

- Go to the Bootswatch website (https://bootswatch.com/) and choose a theme that you like. Click on the type of file button to download the CSS file for the theme.
