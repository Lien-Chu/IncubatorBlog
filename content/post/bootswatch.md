Bootswatch is a free collection of Bootstrap themes that offers a variety of easy-to-use and customizable themes for quickly adding visual style to Bootstrap websites or applications. 

Each theme comes with a CSS file and optional JavaScript files for convenience and customization. 

Bootswatch is a great way to add style and visual appeal to Bootstrap projects without spending a lot of time designing and coding from scratch.

Now that we have our application up and running, let's style it up with Bootswatch!

##### Here are the steps you can follow to add Bootswatch to your application:

- Go to the Bootswatch website (https://bootswatch.com/) and choose a theme that you like. Click on the type of file button to download the CSS file for the theme.
