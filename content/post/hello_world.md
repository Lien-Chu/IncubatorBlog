## The difference between the ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC

ASP.NET is a general-purpose web application framework, while ASP.NET MVC follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. ASP.NET is simpler and easier to learn, while ASP.NET MVC has a more structured and testable approach. 

For beginners, ASP.NET may be more friendly as it provides a simpler and more straightforward approach to web development, while ASP.NET MVC may require a steeper learning curve due to its structured approach.
