##### ASP.NET Core is a web framework that can be used to build web applications and services. 

It provides a lot of features such as cross-platform support, high-performance, middleware, dependency injection, configuration, routing, and logging.

##### On the other hand, ASP.NET Core MVC is an extension of ASP.NET Core that specifically focuses on building web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 

The MVC pattern is a design pattern that separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data layer), View (user interface), and Controller (application logic).

So, in simple terms, ASP.NET Core provides the underlying infrastructure for building web applications, while ASP.NET Core MVC provides a structured approach to building web applications using the MVC pattern. ASP.NET Core MVC is built on top of ASP.NET Core and includes all of its features, plus additional features that are specific to building MVC-based web applications.

### What features that ASP.NET Core MVC can provide?

<br /><br />

**1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:** 

ASP.NET Core MVC separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data layer), View (user interface), and Controller (application logic). This makes it easier to manage and maintain the application.

**2. Routing:** 

ASP.NET Core MVC provides a powerful routing system that allows you to map URLs to actions in your application, making it easy to create SEO-friendly URLs.

**3. Views and Razor templates:** 

ASP.NET Core MVC uses Razor, a powerful templating engine that allows you to create dynamic HTML pages using C# or VB.NET.

**4. Tag Helpers:** 

ASP.NET Core MVC provides a set of built-in tag helpers that simplify HTML rendering and make it easy to create complex UI components.

**5. Validation:**   

ASP.NET Core MVC includes a powerful validation framework that allows you to validate user input and display error messages to the user.

**6. Authentication and Authorization:** 

ASP.NET Core MVC provides built-in support for authentication and authorization, making it easy to secure your application and protect sensitive data.

**7. Dependency Injection:** 

ASP.NET Core MVC includes a built-in Dependency Injection (DI) system that allows you to manage dependencies between different components of your application, making it easier to maintain and test your code.

Overall, ASP.NET Core MVC provides a structure for building web applications using the MVC pattern, which helps to separate concerns and make the application more maintainable. It also includes features such as routing, views and templates, tag helpers, validation, authentication and authorization, and dependency injection, making it a powerful web framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
